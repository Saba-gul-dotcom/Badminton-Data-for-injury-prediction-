# Badminton Injury Prediction Dataset (Synthetic)

This is a synthetic dataset designed to assess the performance of algorithms for predicting injuries in badminton players. It includes player-specific data such as demographics, training load, match performance, and injury history. The dataset can be used to evaluate machine learning models focused on injury risk prediction.

## Dataset Description

The dataset contains the following key columns:

- **Player_ID**: Unique identifier for each player.
- **Age**, **Height_cm**, **Weight_kg**: Basic demographic information.
- **Previous_Injuries**: Count of past injuries sustained by the player.
- **Matches_Played**, **Training_Hours_Per_Week**, **Training_Intensity**: Training and match performance metrics.
- **Injury_Type**, **Recovery_Days**: Type of injury and required recovery period.
- **Physical_Condition_Score**: Numerical score representing the player’s overall physical condition.
- **Singles/Doubles**: Player’s participation category.
- **Injury_Risk**: Predicted injury risk score for the player.

## Use Case

This dataset simulates real-world scenarios to help in developing predictive models for badminton injury risk based on player and match statistics. It can be used for:

- Injury pattern analysis.
- Evaluation of training load and its correlation with injuries.
- Machine learning algorithm performance testing for injury prediction.
